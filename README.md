# Pdf-test-examples

This repo contains all pdf files that crashed pdf.js or were very slow during this https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/how-fast-is-pdf-js/ testing.
All of these are put together for the sake of download simplicity (though i know that storing 350mb of pdf in a repo is horribly wrong).

"Crashed pdf" folder contains pdf files that are listed in this page http://bthorben.github.io/pdfRepo/ crash report. 
"Actual crashed pdf" folder contains files that crashed in up-to-date Firefox using it's default pdf.js.
"Slow pdf" folder contains files that are listed in this page http://bthorben.github.io/pdfRepo/ in the "Slowest pdf" section.
